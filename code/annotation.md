create a folder/module for style survey

give that a api folder

add actions.js && state.js to "api" folder

when user clicks "subscribe" from "crates" page on UI
instead of loading to "subscriptions" page the style 
survey appears
 // 1. this will be an "action"
 // 2. we need to add some sort of style survey property to the user object in the main store
    // a. 


where are we holding the pre designed style applications
